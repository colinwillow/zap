# BUILDINGS -- the Building Forge queue (KORAJIN)

His brief (Oct 27 2026): *"Build retro-Japanese-inspired alien cyberpunk buildings. Each building gets 3 passes. I want them to be great.
Every time you complete the third pass on a building, add it to the inventory I can spawn into the Building Forge, so I can check it out,
run on it, swing on it, blow it up and repair it. Make various TYPES of buildings that are modular and will eventually fit together, with
different functions: bars and ramps, interior and exterior, turrets, ballistae, beams -- floating flying ship buildings, zeppelins, towers."*

## The rules of the loop

- **ONE pass per build.** Pull, read this file, take the first building whose pass count is under 3, do its NEXT pass, `npm run bump`,
  `npm run check`, push to main, tick the pass here with the build number, NOTES.md entry, end the turn. **Shipped unverified** -- no
  headless runs (his rule: he tests, the loop does not).
- **A building is DONE at pass 3**: set its `pass: 3` in `BLDG.list` (index.html) and it shows as done in SPAWN > BUILDINGS.
- **The style** (KORAJIN.md, the Red Hollows): ancient, organic, a little primitive, with mysterious technology embedded -- weathered
  sandstone and plaster, dark timber, red banners with the white diamond spiral, bronze machinery (gears, pipes, lamps), curved roofs with
  upturned eaves, lanterns, cyber accents (a few neon lines, glowing panels), and the turret's goblin-samurai-cyber look.
- **HIS STYLE NOTE (after m1119):** *"Take reference from this dojo white scene and these floating drone things. Wires mixed with future
  drones mixed with ancient shrines mixed with alien tech mixed with off-world gizmos mixed with a zen mountain samurai lodge."* So: the
  arena's clean white-and-grey surfaces and soft light; FLOATING DRONE ORBS (a white egg with a dark ring round it, hovering, bobbing);
  CABLES and WIRES strung between things (sagging, with little lamps or tags on them); shrine pieces (ropes, paper streamers, stone);
  alien gizmos (glowing cores, antennas, dishes); and the zen lodge: dark timber, deep eaves, stone, calm. Ref:
  `images/korajin/ref/forge_style_dojo_drones.webp`. Every building from here gets some of each.
- **AND (his, during m1120):** *"Sentry guns and snowy white-capped mountains with robotic turrets and spider robots and robotic samurai
  guards with bow and arrow on the watchtowers."* So: buildings are MANNED where it fits -- the red ARCHERS (m1103) posted on lookouts and
  walls, the TURRET (m1011) as sentry guns on decks and gates; SPIDER ROBOTS (to build: a six-legged bot that patrols and climbs); and the
  forge's horizon gets a ring of SNOWY WHITE-CAPPED MOUNTAINS (the Refuge's low-poly peaks, whiter). Watchtower pass 2 posts an archer on
  the lookout and a sentry gun on the second deck.
- **AND (his, after m1120):** *"Big fire pits, guard towers and katana masks. And large scale -- everything is big, lots of things that
  are climbable, lots of drawbridges and cross beams, Japanese architecture, perches and different levels, a lot of VERTICALITY."* So from
  here: BUILD BIG (storeys 4 m+, towers 15-25 m, halls you can lose yourself in); every building has MORE THAN ONE LEVEL and more than one
  way up (ramps, ladders, ledges you can climb, bars, beams to run along); CROSS BEAMS and PERCHES jutting out (things to stand on high);
  DRAWBRIDGES (a span that lowers and rises -- the Gatehouse's, the Rampart's); FIRE PITS (big bronze braziers with real flames and
  smoke); KATANA MASKS (giant samurai mask-faces (mempo/oni) on walls and gates, crossed katanas). Later buildings are linked to each other
  by bridges and beams at height, so the courtyard reads as one climbable whole.
- **Every building is PLAYABLE**: breakable walls (`cwallBuild`, they repair), things to swing on (`hbarMake`), things to climb or run up
  (ramps: walkable `triAdd` surfaces, rise <= .32 m a step), an inside and an outside, and where it fits a function (a turret, a ballista,
  a balance beam, a lookout). Code-built and merged per material (draw calls matter on his phone).
- **MODULAR**: each building stands in its own spot in the forge (`at`), on a grid of 4 m units, its doors on its sides' centres, so
  later they can be set side by side into a courtyard.
- **WHEN THE QUEUE RUNS OUT (his, after m1123):** *"If you run out of things to make tonight do another brainstorm pass of another set, and
  then again later if you run out again after that, etc."* So: when every row below is done, spend ONE pass brainstorming the NEXT SET
  (8-12 new buildings / props / moves in his style notes, each with a function and a spot in the forge), append it as a new table here,
  and carry on building. Repeat every time a set runs out. The loop never stops for lack of a queue.
- **AND EXTRA PASSES (his, after m1124):** *"You can also continue with detail passes -- you can do an additional 3 passes on things
  already completed."* So a DONE building may get passes 4-6 (more detail, more function, more delight) -- mark them in its row as
  `4 (mNNNN)` etc. Order of work: new buildings in the queue first; when the queue is out, alternate between brainstorming a new set and
  giving the done buildings their extra passes (oldest first), so the forge gets both new things and better old ones.
- **EVERYTHING THAT SHOOTS CAN BE KILLED (his, during m1128):** *"Don't forget to make the turrets and stuff destroyable -- I could kill
  it."* Every turret, ballista, cannon, spider bot or gizmo that attacks takes katana hits, his shots and its own shots parried back
  (`bldHit` is the hook: add the new weapon there), breaks visibly (sparks, smoke, slumps), stops, and is REPAIRED after a while.
- **Pass meaning**: 1 = the building stands, playable (shell, roof, doors, the main feature). 2 = the details and the function (interior,
  the moving parts, lights, the special feature working). 3 = the polish (proportions, colour, silhouette, one more delight).
